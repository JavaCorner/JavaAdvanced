 *
 * Threads can be created by using two mechanisms :
 *      Extending the Thread class
 *      Implementing the Runnable Interface (Recommended)
 *
 * If we extend the Thread class, our class cannot extend any other class because Java doesnâ€™t support multiple inheritance
 * Using runnable will give you an object that can be shared amongst multiple threads.
 *
 * Thread Lifecycle
 *      NEW:            Thread has not yet started
 *      RUNNABLE:       Thread is executing
 *      BLOCKED:        Thread is blocked, waiting for monitor lock to be released
 *      WAITING:        Thread is waiting as long as it takes for another thread's signal
 *      TIMED_WAITING:  Thread is waiting for a specified period of time
 *      TERMINATED:     Thread is exited
