 * Livelock
 *      is a special case of resource starvation.
 *      is similar to a deadlock, except that the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing.
 *      Threads form an indefinite loop, expecting confirmation of completion from one another
 *      In real life imagine 2 persons standing on a door waiting for each other to pass.
